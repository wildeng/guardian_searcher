# GuardianSearcher

This is a work in progress, and its status is currently not even an alpha version. Tests needs to be implemented and the code is not optimal.
The goal of this project is to provide a Ruby wrapper to query the Guardian Api and to experiment with some programming techniques.

If you wanna try it you need to have an API key and use it as an environment variable.

```bash
  export guardian_api_key = "<your_api_key"
```
## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'guardian_searcher'
```

And then execute:

    $ bundle install

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install guardian_searcher

## Usage

TODO: Write usage instructions here

## Development

After checking out the repo, run `bin/setup` to install dependencies. Then, run `rake spec` to run the tests. You can also run `bin/console` for an interactive prompt that will allow you to experiment.

To install this gem onto your local machine, run `bundle exec rake install`. To release a new version, update the version number in `version.rb`, and then run `bundle exec rake release`, which will create a git tag for the version, push git commits and the created tag, and push the `.gem` file to [rubygems.org](https://rubygems.org).
